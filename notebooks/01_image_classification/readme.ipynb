    "You will practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline, based on the k-Nearest Neighbor or the SVM/Softmax classifier. The goals of this assignment are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- understand the basic **Image Classification pipeline** and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)\n",
    "- understand the train/val/test **splits** and the use of validation data for **hyperparameter tuning**.\n",
    "- develop proficiency in writing efficient **vectorized** code with numpy\n",
    "- implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (**kNN**) classifier\n",
    "- implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (**SVM**) classifier\n",
    "- implement and apply a **Softmax** classifier\n",
    "- implement and apply a **Two layer neural network** classifier\n",
    "- understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers\n",
    "- get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using **higher-level representations** than raw pixels (e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features)"
