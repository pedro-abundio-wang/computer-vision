description: How to implement, train and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. Training a multi-million parameter convolutional neural network and applying it on the largest image classification dataset (ImageNet). Focus on how to set up the problem of image recognition, the learning algorithms (e.g. backpropagation), practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning the networks.
